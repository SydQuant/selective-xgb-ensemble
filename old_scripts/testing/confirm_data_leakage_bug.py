Confirm Data Leakage Bug - The Framework Killer
===============================================

CONFIRMED: Feature selection is applied to the FULL dataset before CV.
This is CLASSIC data leakage that invalidates ALL results.

The process is:
1. Load full dataset (2015-2025)
2. Apply feature selection using ALL data including future test periods  ‚Üê BUG!
3. Then run CV on the pre-selected features

This means every CV fold is using features that were selected using
data from future folds. This is textbook data leakage.
