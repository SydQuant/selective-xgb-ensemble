Model Reselection Logic Audit
============================

The most insidious bug: Model reselection using future performance data.

This checks:
1. QUALITY TRACKING TIMING - Is quality calculated on future data?
2. RESELECTION CONTAMINATION - Does model selection see future performance?
3. FOLD BOUNDARY VIOLATIONS - Models selected using post-fold data?
4. Q-METRIC CALCULATION TIMING - When is quality metric computed?
5. ENSEMBLE WEIGHTS LEAKAGE - Are weights set using future returns?

If reselection uses ANY future data, all results are meaningless.
