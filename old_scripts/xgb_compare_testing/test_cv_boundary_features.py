Test Cross-Validation Boundary Feature Calculation

This tests whether rolling features are calculated correctly across CV boundaries.
The key issue: features should be calculated on the FULL dataset, then split for CV.
If features are calculated separately on train/test, rolling windows break at boundaries.
